/* Cozy Tavern — js/assemble/plainvoice.js
 * M359: READING HIS OWN PRESET FOR AN ASSISTANT'S VOICE. He asked whether the house could look over the whole preset
 * (forty thousand words of it) instead of him pasting it somewhere. It can — mechanically, with no model and no wire:
 * the words that make a teller sound like an assistant are a short, knowable list, and every line that holds one can be
 * named where he can see it. It rewrites nothing: his words are his, and a machine guessing at his prose is how a voice
 * gets flattened. It only says: this line, this word, here.
 *   - BREAKS THE VOICE: the words that name the machinery (an assistant, a model, a prompt, the user, a policy) or the
 *     apologetic register nobody in a story uses ("I cannot", "I apologize", "Let me know").
 *   - SOUNDS LIKE A MANUAL: the register of documentation rather than of a person telling a story. */
