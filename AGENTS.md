# AGENTS.md — notes for whoever tends the tavern next

Human or AI, these are the house rules. Read them before touching anything.

## The one rule above all

`SPEC.md` is the binding contract for each milestone. Implement it exactly.
If the spec and the code ever disagree, stop and surface the conflict — do
not improvise.

## Voice (applies to every user-facing string)

UI copy reads like a person keeping a writing desk: warm, plain, unhurried.
"The story so far", "Who's here", "The frame", "The note at the end" —
never "Settings Manager v1.2", never gamification, badges, or neon. Buttons
say human things: "Keep it", "Not now", "Take a copy". Errors apologize and
point at a next step; they never show a stack.

## Hard constraints (locked)

- No build step, no npm, no frameworks. Vanilla ES modules only.
- No external CDNs, no remote fonts. Everything self-contained.
- All data local (IndexedDB). API keys leave the device only toward the
  chosen provider's endpoint.
- Runs from GitHub Pages *and* `bash serve.sh` on Termux (localhost:8080).
  Keep every URL in the app relative.
- Mobile-first. Prose measure ~65ch, serif for prose, system sans for chrome.
- Dark + light themes; respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless overridden.

## Performance laws (locked)

- Exactly ONE streaming generation call per user turn. No pre-calls, no
  agent chains on the send path.
- TTFT: the system prefix must stay stable byte-for-byte so provider-side
  prompt caching hits (anthropic gets `cache_control: ephemeral` on the last
  system block). Nothing dynamic goes before it.

## Contracts to preserve

- `js/store.js` — `export const db` with `settings`, `connections`,
  `stories`, `messages`, `exportAll()`, `importAll(json)`. Promise-based.
  Namespace: `cozytavern.v1` (DB name and backup envelope).
- `js/providers/index.js` — `createProvider(connection)` →
  `{ test(), streamChat({system, messages, signal, onToken}) }`.
- `js/assemble/stack.js` — `buildRequest({story, messages, settings})` →
  `{system, messages}`. **M2 replaces the internals; keep this signature.**
- Service worker: cache-first same-origin shell, network-only for
  cross-origin (API) traffic.

## Seams left for later milestones (do not fill yet)

- `js/engine/` — the scene-state engine. The drawer panels in
  `js/ui/drawer.js` are data-driven stubs waiting for it (M3–M4).
- `js/agents/` — background agents. None may join the send path (see
  performance laws).
- Receipts — a record of what was sent and returned. Lands after the engine.
- `js/assemble/stack.js` is the M1 minimal assembler: frame as system, note
  appended as a final user message. M2 makes assembly position-aware behind
  the same interface.

## Conventions

- Small modules, one job each. UI modules receive a shared context object
  from `js/app.js`; they don't reach into each other.
- Store changes go through `db` only — no direct `indexedDB` calls elsewhere.
- New user-facing copy gets read aloud once before shipping. If it sounds
  like software, rewrite it.

# M2 — what changed, and what to hold onto

## What changed

- `js/assemble/stack.js` was rewritten into the full ten-slot, cache-aware
  assembler. The export name `buildRequest` and the starter texts did not
  move. The slot order is law — see the header comment in the file.
- `js/assemble/modules.js` (new) — the rulebook: builtin + user modules,
  pins, predicate stubs, persistence. Builtin texts are condensed from the
  V176 audit, 300–600 words each, no emoji headers.
- `js/assemble/receipt.js` (new) — token estimation (ceil(chars/4)) and
  `finalizeReceipt`. Receipts persist on the assistant message
  (`msg.receipt`) and open via "What the storyteller saw" under each reply.
- `js/engine/state.js` (new) — the per-story state object. M2 writes only
  `present` by hand (the ledger's Who's here panel). Everything else is the
  M3 engine's to fill.
- `js/ui/receiptview.js` (new) — the receipt sheet.
- Providers: `streamChat` now resolves `{text, ttftMs, durationMs}` and
  accepts `systemBlocks` ([{text, cache}]) alongside the M1 string `system`.
- `js/ui/settings.js` gained The rulebook, plus per-story The brief and
  Who's here (cast notes). `js/ui/drawer.js`'s Who's here panel is real.

## Contracts added (M2)

- `buildRequest({story, messages, settings, state, modules})` →
  `{systemBlocks:[{text, cache}], messages, receipt:ReceiptDraft}` where
  `modules` is the selected list from `selectModules` ([{mod, reason}]).
- `state.js`: `emptyState()`, `loadState(id)`, `saveState(id, state)`,
  `renderStateFacts(state)` → string | `''`.
- `modules.js`: `listModules()`, `saveModule(mod)`, `removeModule(id)`,
  `selectModules(modules, state)` → `[{mod, reason}]`. Predicates are
  keyed (`always`/`intimate`/`combat`/`acoustics`) because functions can't
  persist; saved rows re-attach by key. Editing a builtin forks it (a user
  row with the same id); removing the fork restores the original.
- `receipt.js`: `finalizeReceipt(draft, {ttftMs, durationMs, model})` →
  `{v:1, ts, slots:[{name,tokens,source,reason}], totalTokens, ttftMs,
  durationMs, model, stateSummary}`.
- Providers: `streamChat({systemBlocks|system, messages, signal, onToken})`
  → `{text, ttftMs, durationMs}`. Anthropic: system array, `cache_control`
  ephemeral on the LAST cache:true block. OpenAI: cache:true blocks
  concatenate into ONE system message; dynamic slots are user messages,
  never system.
- Wire mapping (documented in stack.js): slots 1–4 → systemBlocks;
  slots 5–6 → ONE user message marked `[story-state]` at the FRONT of the
  messages array; slot 8 = history; slot 10 (when it fires) just before
  slot 9; slot 9 (the note) is always the LAST message.
- State and rulebook persistence ride in the settings store
  (`state:<storyId>`, `modules`) — no schema change, and backups carry both.

## Known seams for M3 (do not fill early)

- `state.js` keys `clock`, `mode`, `bodies`, `relationships`, `offscreen`,
  `factions`, `threads` are the engine's to write. `renderStateFacts`
  already renders anything present.
- Module predicates read hand-set state. The acoustics heuristic is
  documented in modules.js: a present name counts as she/her when the
  story's cast notes (passed in as `state.castNotes` by the send path) mark
  it so, or when the ledger name itself carries "(she/her)". M3's event
  extraction replaces the hand-setting, not the predicates.
- Slot 7 (What remains) is recorded on every receipt, sent as nothing — the
  memory slot, M6.
- Receipts are written but never read by the app itself; no engine consumes
  them yet.

# M3 — the scene-state engine & the workers

## What changed

- `js/engine/clock.js` (new) — the in-world clock. State is
  `{calendar, minutes, label, monthNames?, dayNames?}` where minutes counts
  from the proleptic Gregorian epoch (Hinnant's days-from-civil, exact leap
  years, no Date objects or timezones). `createClock`/`setClock`/
  `advanceClock` are pure (fresh copies out); `advanceClock` clamps deltas
  to 0..24*365 minutes. Custom calendars carry their own month/day names
  and borrow the real ones for any unnamed slot. No travel ETAs — that's M4.
- `js/engine/apply.js` (new) — the only place mutations become true.
  Validates the closed v1 vocabulary, applies deterministically, writes a
  plain-words line to `state.log` per change (cap 200), and stores an `undo`
  payload on each line so `undoLast` can take it back.
- `js/engine/state.js` (extended) — state v2: `log:[]` joins the shape,
  present entries may carry `position`/`attire`. `loadState` migrates M2
  states with no loss (string presence entries become `{name}`; an M2
  `{iso,label}` clock keeps rendering until the engine sets it properly).
  Adds `subscribe(storyId, fn)` / `notify(storyId)` — in-memory only; the
  drawer re-renders on change.
- `js/agents/extractor.js` (new) — the background worker. Runs AFTER the
  stream completes, never on the critical path, and never throws into the
  chat path: every failure is `{mutations:[]}`. Anthropic gets an assistant
  prefill of `"{"`; OpenAI gets `response_format: json_object` only when the
  address really is api.openai.com; everywhere relies on the tolerant parser
  (fences stripped, first balanced `{...}` respecting strings). max_tokens
  400, temperature 0. Also holds the in-flight tracker:
  `noteExtraction(storyId, promise)` / `pendingExtraction(storyId, ms)`.
- `js/ui/drawer.js` (rewritten panels) — The clock (label, set-by-hand,
  +15m/+1h/custom advance, calendar mode + comma-list names), Who's here
  (position/attire shown; hand add/remove now rides through mutations so
  it's logged), The mood of the scene (plain-words checkboxes), What changed
  and why (newest first, "Take it back" on the newest standing entry).
  "On their mind" stays a stub — M4.
- `js/ui/settings.js` (extended) — The workers: agent connection picker
  (`workerConnectionId` setting; '' = same as the storyteller) and the
  per-story extraction toggle (`story.extraction`, default on).
- `js/ui/chat.js` (extended) — fires the extractor after the assistant page
  is saved (fire-and-forget); the send path awaits
  `pendingExtraction(storyId, 5000)` before assembling; writes
  `msg.extraction = {appliedWords, rejectedCount}` back onto the same
  assistant message and re-renders its receipt line.
- `js/ui/receiptview.js` (extended) — `openReceipt(receipt, extraction)`;
  the sheet ends with "After this turn" when an extraction exists.
- `js/store.js` (additive) — `messages.append` passes `extraction` through
  the same way it passes `receipt`; re-appending a message with its id
  re-inks the page (that's how the extraction lands after the fact).
- `sw.js` — cache bumped to v3; the three new modules joined the shell list.

## The mutation vocabulary (v1 — closed list; unknown types rejected)

```
clock.set {year,month,day,hour,minute}     clock.advance {minutes, reason}
presence.enter {name, position?, attire?}  presence.leave {name}
presence.update {name, position?, attire?}
mode.set {flag, reason}                    mode.clear {flag}
```
flag ∈ combat, intimate, travel, socialField, isolation, group. Names
normalize (trim, collapse whitespace; matching is case-insensitive, stored
casing wins). `applyMutations(state, mutations)` → `{state, applied:
[{mutation, words}], rejected: [{mutation, why}]}` — `words` is the sentence
the log speaks. `undoLast(state)` → `{state, words}` | null.

## Contracts to preserve (added in M3)

- `clock.js`: `createClock({calendar, start})`, `setClock(state, parts)`,
  `advanceClock(state, deltaMinutes, reason)`, `renderClock(state)`.
- `apply.js`: `applyMutations`, `undoLast`, plus `MODE_FLAGS`/`MODE_WORDS`
  (the drawer's mood panel shares the words).
- `state.js`: v2 shape + `subscribe`/`notify`.
- `extractor.js`: `extractTurn({connection, state, userText, assistantText,
  signal})` → `{mutations}` — never throws; `noteExtraction` /
  `pendingExtraction` — the send path's courtesy wait.

## The latency law, restated

One streamed generation per user turn. The extractor fires only after the
stream completes and its promise is never awaited by the turn that fired it.
The NEXT send awaits `pendingExtraction(storyId, 5000)` — hard ceiling, then
last-good state — before `buildRequest`. State consistency without prose
ever waiting on the workers.

## Seams for M4 (do not fill early)

- `state.bodies`, `state.relationships`, `state.offscreen`, `state.factions`
  exist and `renderStateFacts` already passes anything in them along, but no
  engine writes them. "On their mind" in the drawer is their panel.
- The clock doesn't derive travel ETAs; that rides with the offscreen engine.
- `state.log` entries carry `undo` payloads beyond the documented
  `{ts, words, undone}` — the additive piece undoLast needs. Keep them when
  touching the log shape.
- The extractor's vocabulary is v1-closed; M4 engines (bodies,
  relationships) will want new mutation types — extend HANDLERS in apply.js
  and the prompt's vocabulary list together, never one without the other.
